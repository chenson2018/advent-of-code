# advent-of-code

This repository contains my solutions to the challenges posted at https://adventofcode.com/

My goal is to use this as a way to learn new programming languages and have a bit of fun.

# Languages

I've found that Github's feature for identifying languages is a bit buggy, so here are some links that search by file extension:

- [Python](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Achenson2018%2Fadvent-of-code+extension%3A.py&type=Code&ref=advsearch&l=&l=)
- [OCaml](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Achenson2018%2Fadvent-of-code+extension%3A.ml&type=Code&ref=advsearch&l=&l=)

# Incomplete Solutions

Note: 2021 Day 16 and the Assembly solution to 2021 Day 1 are incomplete.
